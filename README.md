# üçΩÔ∏è Point of Sale(POS) SYSTEM

A modern, lightweight Point of Sale (POS) system built using:

    Go as the backend

    PocketBase as the local database and authentication provider

    HTMX for reactive UI

    Gomponents for declarative HTML rendering

    üîê Auth is powered by PocketBase with JWT tokens, stored in secure HTTP-only cookies.
